        <h2 class="section-title">Tip 1: Use the Right Keywords</h2>
        <p>The first and most important step in finding the perfect image on ShutterStock is using the right keywords. ShutterStock’s search engine works best when you input relevant and specific terms related to your desired image. Consider what you need in terms of subject, style, and mood.</p>
        <p>For instance, instead of searching for a generic term like “business,” narrow it down by adding more details like “business meeting,” “business team,” or “business woman in office.” By adding descriptive terms, you will be able to find images that fit your specific needs. Make sure to use singular or plural forms based on the image you are looking for, and if necessary, try synonyms to broaden or refine your results.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Tip 4: Use Synonyms and Related Terms</h2>
        <p>If your initial search doesn’t provide the results you are looking for, try using synonyms or related terms. ShutterStock’s search engine is designed to help you find similar content based on different terminology. For example, if you are searching for an image of a “laptop,” try related terms like “computer,” “notebook,” or “desktop” to broaden the pool of results.</p>
        <p>Additionally, think about the context in which the image will be used. If you need an image of a “businesswoman,” also consider using terms like “female entrepreneur,” “executive,” or “professional woman” to get a wider variety of images.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Tip 6: Consider Licensing Options</h2>
        <p>ShutterStock offers various licensing options for its images, and it’s essential to choose the right one for your needs. When searching for the perfect image, take note of the image's licensing terms to ensure that it fits your intended use. ShutterStock typically offers two types of licenses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard License:</strong> This is ideal for most personal and commercial projects. It includes the right to use the image in various media, such as websites, blogs, advertisements, and printed materials.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced License:</strong> This option offers more flexibility, including the ability to use the image on products for resale (e.g., t-shirts, mugs) or in high-traffic media like apps and software.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Always check the licensing details before making a purchase to ensure that the image is suitable for your intended use and that you are in compliance with ShutterStock’s usage rights.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Tip 7: Pay Attention to Image Resolution</h2>
        <p>Choosing the right resolution for your image is crucial. ShutterStock offers images in various resolutions, including small, medium, large, and extra-large sizes. The resolution you choose depends on the scale and quality requirements of your project.</p>
        <p>If you are working on a large-scale project such as a print advertisement, brochure, or banner, you will need to select images with higher resolution to ensure they print clearly and without pixelation. On the other hand, for smaller digital projects such as blog posts or social media posts, a medium resolution image may be sufficient.</p>
        <p>Always check the resolution before downloading, especially for high-quality prints or large projects. You can easily find this information in the image details section.</p>
