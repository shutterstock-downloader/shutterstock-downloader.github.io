        <h2>How to Choose the Best Images on ShutterStock</h2>
        <p>ShutterStock has an immense collection of images, and it can be overwhelming to find the perfect one for your project. Here are a few tips to help you choose the best images:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Use Specific Keywords</h3>
        <p>To narrow down your search, use specific keywords that describe the kind of image you need. For example, if you're looking for a photo of a "business meeting," type that exact phrase into the search bar. The more specific your search, the more relevant results you'll get.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Filter by Image Type</h3>
        <p>ShutterStock offers several types of content, including photos, vectors, illustrations, and videos. Make sure to use the filters to select the right image type for your project.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Check Image Resolution</h3>
        <p>If you're planning to use the image for print or any large-scale design, make sure the resolution is high enough. Look for images labeled as "high-resolution" or "HD" to ensure the best quality for your project.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Look for Royalty-Free Images</h3>
        <p>ShutterStock offers both royalty-free and rights-managed images. To avoid any legal issues, always choose royalty-free images for commercial use.</p>

        <h2>Common Issues and How to Solve Them</h2>
        <p>Although our ShutterStock Downloader tool is simple and reliable, you might encounter some issues while using it. Here are a few common problems and their solutions:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Image Not Downloading</h3>
        <p>If the image doesn’t download, make sure you’ve copied the correct URL from ShutterStock. Sometimes, copying the URL from the wrong section of the webpage (such as from the preview image) can cause issues. Always copy the URL from the image's dedicated page.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Slow Download Speed</h3>
        <p>If the download speed is slow, it could be due to a slow internet connection or the size of the image. Try pausing other downloads or using a faster internet connection to speed things up.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Invalid URL Error</h3>
        <p>If you see an "invalid URL" error, double-check that you've copied the entire URL correctly. The URL should begin with "https://www.shutterstock.com" followed by the unique ID for the image.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Image Not in High Resolution</h3>
        <p>If the image isn't downloading in high resolution, ensure you're selecting the full-resolution option on ShutterStock before copying the URL. Our tool will fetch the highest available resolution, but it depends on the image's availability.</p>
