        <h2 class="section-title">Understanding Alamy’s License Types</h2>
        <p>Before licensing any photos from Alamy, it’s important to understand the types of licenses available. Alamy offers flexible licensing options that cater to different usage needs. Here are the most common types of licenses you’ll come across:</p>

        <h3>1. Royalty-Free (RF) License</h3>
        <p>The Royalty-Free (RF) license is one of the most popular licensing models. It allows you to use the image as many times as you want in various projects without having to pay royalties. Once you purchase an RF license, the image can be used in multiple campaigns, websites, presentations, and more. However, there are a few limitations, such as not being able to resell the image or use it in a product for resale (e.g., t-shirts, mugs).</p>

        <h3>2. Rights-Managed (RM) License</h3>
        <p>The Rights-Managed (RM) license is more restrictive than RF. With RM, the image is licensed for a specific usage and a set period of time. This type of license allows you to use the image for specific purposes such as print ads, websites, or social media campaigns. The cost of RM licenses is typically higher than RF, but they are ideal for projects that require exclusive or high-value images.</p>

        <h3>3. Editorial Use License</h3>
        <p>An Editorial Use License is used for images that will be featured in editorial content, such as news articles, blogs, and educational materials. These images cannot be used for commercial purposes like advertising or product packaging. Editorial images often depict real-world events, public figures, or sensitive topics, and they are labeled as “editorial use only” to indicate that they cannot be used for marketing purposes.</p>

        <h3>4. Extended License</h3>
        <p>The Extended License allows for more flexible use of images. If you need to use the image in a product for resale or if you require exclusive rights, the Extended License is the way to go. It offers additional usage rights compared to a standard RF license and is perfect for businesses looking to use images in commercial products or high-profile advertising campaigns.</p>

        <h3>5. Creative Commons License</h3>
        <p>Some images on Alamy may also be available under a Creative Commons license, which typically allows you to use the image for free with certain conditions. This type of license usually requires attribution and may have restrictions depending on the image. Always check the specific conditions before using Creative Commons images.</p>

        <p>It’s essential to carefully select the correct license based on how you plan to use the image. Choosing the right license helps avoid legal issues and ensures that you’re abiding by copyright laws.</p>
