            <li><strong>Color Scheme:</strong> Does your project have a specific color palette? If so, choose images that align with these colors.</li>
            <li><strong>Style:</strong> Are you looking for realistic images, abstract visuals, or something in between?</li>
            <li><strong>Size and Orientation:</strong> Think about the dimensions you need for your project (e.g., horizontal or vertical images).</li>

        <h2>2. Use Keywords Effectively</h2>
        <p>Adobe Stock’s search functionality relies heavily on keywords. The more specific and accurate your search terms, the better the results. Here are some tips for using keywords effectively:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start with Broad Keywords:</strong> If you’re not sure exactly what you need, start by entering broad keywords (e.g., “business” or “nature”) to get a feel for the available images.</li>
            <li><strong>Refine with Specific Keywords:</strong> Once you have a broad set of results, narrow them down by adding more specific terms (e.g., “business meeting,” “nature landscape”).</li>
            <li><strong>Use Synonyms and Related Terms:</strong> If you’re not finding what you’re looking for, try using synonyms or related words (e.g., “teamwork” vs. “collaboration” or “forest” vs. “woodland”).</li>
            <li><strong>Include the Style or Mood:</strong> Keywords like “minimalist,” “vintage,” “dramatic lighting,” or “bright” can help you find photos that match the visual tone you want.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Effective use of keywords will dramatically increase your chances of finding the perfect photo in less time.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Image Type:</strong> Choose from photos, vectors, illustrations, and videos to ensure you’re getting the right media type for your project.</li>
            <li><strong>Color:</strong> If you need a specific color scheme, filter results by color to find images that complement your design.</li>
            <li><strong>Orientation:</strong> Select either horizontal or vertical images depending on the layout of your project.</li>
            <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Ensure the image’s resolution matches your needs, especially for print projects that require higher resolution.</li>
            <li><strong>License Type:</strong> Filter for standard or extended licenses based on your intended use (e.g., commercial vs. editorial). </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These filters will help you zero in on the perfect stock photos faster and more efficiently.</p>
